Rock, Paper, Scissors in JavaScript

A simple RPS game ran through JavaScript's console. Took a bit longer than expected fixing bugs, but overall it works properly.
Definitely room for improvements, i.e.:
- calling error when invalid input is entered
- fixing case sensitivity so it isn't strict
- adding a GUI
